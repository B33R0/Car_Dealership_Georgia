This code parses the information on ss.ge.
It takes the information about the cars in georgia on the fist 7 pages and saves them in 
the csv file "cars". 
The information is about the model of the car, year, location, odometer in kms, transmission,
engine, steering wheel placement, price in GEL and price in USD.
Tge only minus of this code is that information is in Georgian language and caqn be better used by Georgians and people who speak Georgian. But if need be every sentence can be copied in google translate. SO ENJOY :) :)
